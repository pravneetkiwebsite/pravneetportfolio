                                                        generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
                                                        them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.</p>
